# CONV018: Module Folder Organization
#
# Flags a module that has grown past a readable size while keeping every
# document loose in the module root — no folders at all.
#
# Studio Pro lets a module hold folders, and every Mendix style guide expects
# them once a module is more than a handful of documents. Nothing in mxcli
# reported their absence, so a project with 200 documents in one flat module
# scored clean.
#
# THE CONDITION IS DELIBERATELY NARROW, and both halves matter:
#
#   1. more than MAX_ROOT_DOCUMENTS documents sit directly in the module root, AND
#   2. NOT ONE document in the module is in a folder.
#
# The second half is what keeps this from becoming noise. A module that has
# started to organise itself — even one folder — is never flagged, however many
# documents remain at its root, because the team has evidently made a choice
# about where things go and a linter guessing at the rest would be nagging. The
# first half exempts genuinely small modules, where a folder tree costs more
# than it repays. Together they catch exactly one thing: a module nobody has
# ever organised.
#
# Options (.claude/lint-config.yaml):
#   rules:
#     CONV018:
#       options:
#         max_root_documents: 40   # default 20 — documents allowed at a module
#                                  # root before folders are expected
#
# Document properties (documents()):
#   .kind           - catalog ObjectType: "MICROFLOW", "PAGE", "WORKFLOW", …
#   .name           - document name
#   .qualified_name - Module.Name
#   .module_name    - the module holding it
#   .folder         - folder path, or "" when the document is in the module root

# The kinds Studio Pro actually lets you file in a folder.
#
# `documents()` projects the whole catalog `objects` view, which includes rows
# whose Folder is hardcoded empty because the element is not a document at all —
# an association belongs to the domain model, an external entity to a consumed
# service, an entity to the Domain Model document. Counting those would report a
# module as unorganised on the strength of elements no one can move.
#
# An allow-list rather than a deny-list on purpose: a document type added to the
# catalog and forgotten here is undercounted, so the rule stays quiet. The other
# polarity would invent violations out of a new non-foldered kind.
