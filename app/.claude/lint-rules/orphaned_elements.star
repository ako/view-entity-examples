# Starlark Lint Rule: Orphaned Elements
#
# This rule checks for elements that are not referenced anywhere in the project.
# Orphaned elements may be:
#   - Dead code that should be removed
#   - Entry points that should be documented
#   - Work in progress that was forgotten
#
# Checks:
#   - Microflows with no callers (except ACT_ which are UI entry points)
#   - Pages with no show_page references (except entry pages)
#   - Entities with no references at all
#
# This rule requires REFRESH CATALOG FULL to populate the refs table.
