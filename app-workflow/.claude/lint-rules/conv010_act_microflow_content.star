# CONV010: ACT_ Microflow Content Restriction
#
# Microflows prefixed with ACT_ are page action microflows. They should only
# contain UI-related activities:
#   - ShowPageAction (show page)
#   - ClosePageAction (close page)
#   - ShowHomePageAction (show home page)
#   - ShowMessageAction (show message)
#   - DownloadFileAction (download file)
#   - MicroflowCallAction (call sub-microflow for logic delegation)
#
# Business logic should be delegated to SUB_ microflows.
# Requires FULL catalog (REFRESH CATALOG FULL).
#
# NOTE ON NAMES: the catalog labels an action with its *SDK* type name, derived
# from the parsed action's Go type (catalog.getMicroflowActionType). That is not
# always the name Mendix uses in BSON: ShowPageAction is stored as
# "Microflows$ShowFormAction", ClosePageAction as "CloseFormAction", and so on
# (see the storage-name table in CLAUDE.md). This rule matches what the linter
# sees, so it must use the SDK names — it previously used the storage names and
# therefore matched nothing, flagging every ACT_ microflow that showed a page,
# closed one, or called a sub-microflow. Both spellings are listed so the rule
# keeps working if the catalog's vocabulary is ever changed to the storage names.

# ExclusiveMerge is here because an `if` produces BOTH a split and a merge. The
# list allowed the split and forbade the join it necessarily creates, so an ACT_
# microflow that guards anything — "do not open a page with an empty parameter" —
# could not be written cleanly: the guard was permitted and its own closing brace
# was reported. Measured on a microflow whose ONLY violation was the merge, and
# 122 times over on one real project.
