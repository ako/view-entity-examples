# Starlark Lint Rule: Missing Documentation
#
# Undocumented model elements are invisible to `mxcli check` and to the build —
# nothing fails, so nothing reminds you. This rule is the reminder, and it
# covers every document type a user authors, not just the domain model.
#
# Documents swept generically (one option each, all default True):
#   Entity, Page, Snippet, BuildingBlock, Layout, Enumeration,
#   JavaScriptAction, ImageCollection, DataTransformer, Workflow,
#   BusinessEventService, RestClient, PublishedRestService, Constant,
#   JsonStructure, ImportMapping, ExportMapping
#
# Handled separately, because they carry exemptions or children a uniform
# sweep cannot express:
#   Microflow          .description   (nanoflows and trivial flows exempt)
#   JavaAction         .documentation
#   JavaAction params  .description   <- the one Studio Pro shows a CALLER
#
# Members, off by default purely because of volume:
#   Attribute          .description
#   Association        .description
#
# Why Java action parameters default ON while attributes default OFF: an action
# has a handful of parameters and Studio Pro renders each description in the
# dialog where someone wires up the call — an undocumented parameter is a blank
# field next to a name like `pInput` at exactly the moment a caller has to
# decide what to pass. A domain model has hundreds of attributes and
# associations, so the same check there is a wall of text rather than a signal.
#
# Every kind is individually switchable; see the table in _DOC_KINDS and the
# options listed under docs-site/src/tools/starlark-rules.md.
